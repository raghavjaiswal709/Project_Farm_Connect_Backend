# Farm-Connect Web Application Documentation


## Introduction

The Farm-Connect web application is a platform designed to connect farmers with wholesalers, enabling the exchange of locally grown products. It allows farmers to upload their products, and wholesalers can browse and purchase these products directly from the farmers.
## Features
- Farmers can upload products they have grown.
- Wholesalers can browse products uploaded by farmers and purchase them.
- Wholesalers can bargain with farmers on product prices.
- Notification system for farmers to accept or reject bargain requests.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

## Architecture Overview
The application follows the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack architecture.

- **Client Side** (Frontend): React.js is used to build the user interface and handle client-side interactions.

- **Server Side** (Backend): Node.js with Express.js is used to handle server-side logic and API endpoints.

- **Database**: MongoDB is used as the database to store user data, product information, and bargain requests.

-**Authentication**: JWT is used for user authentication and authorization.

## Installation:
**Prerequisites**
- Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine.
- MongoDB should be installed and running.

**Steps**

```


   **Backend:**
```python
git clone https://github.com/raghavjaiswal709/Project_Farm_Connect_Backend.git 
```

2. Rename Folder **Project_Farm_Connect_Backend** to **Backend**
3. Rename Folder **Project_Farm_Connect_frontend** to **frontend**
4. Navigate to the project directory:
```python
cd frontend
```
5. Install dependencies for Backend:
```python
npm install
```

6. Set up environment variables:
